title: "The discerning eye of computer vision: Can it measure Parkinson's finger tap bradykinesia?"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/William2020c
excerpt: 'New computer vision software, DeepLabCut, can quantify three measures related to Parkinson’s bradykinesia
from smartphone videos of finger tapping. Objective ‘contactless’ measures of standard clinical examinations
were not previously possible with wearable sensors (accelerometers, gyroscopes, infrared markers).
DeepLabCut requires only conventional video recording of clinical examination and is entirely ‘contactless’.
This next generation technology holds potential for Parkinson’s and other neurological disorders with altered
movements.'
