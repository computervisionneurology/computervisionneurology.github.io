Our group focuses on the Computer Vision and AI applied to neurological diseases. Members of the group share a vision to develop technologies
that can be used by clinicians and patients to improve health outcomes for people who are affected by neurological conditions. Our interdisciplinary
expertise spans Clinical Neurology, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Statistics, and Health Informatics.

Our collaborators include world-leading clinicians from the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation and Royal United Hospitals Trusts, and Aire Logic,
the UK's largest healthtech consultancy.

Current Projects
======
We are currently investigating the limitations of subjective assessment of motor skills, 
and developing computer vision tools that allow objective assessment. Recent work has
included:

1. Automatic, video-based measurement of hand tremor frequency and amplitude.
2. Inter-rater reliability comparison of neurologist assessment of finger-tapping bradykinesia.

Group Members
======
Jane Alty - Dr Alty is a medically qualified Neurology Consultant and early career researcher.
Her inter-disciplinary research focuses on motor biomarkers and the development of computer-aided 
devices to improve the diagnostic accuracy of neurodegenerative disorders.  She was employed in the 
UK National Health Service (NHS) for 18 years until 2019, when she was recruited by the University of 
Tasmania as an academic neurologist. Dr Alty is now a Senior Lecturer in Neurology at the Wicking Dementia 
Centre and Neurologist at RHH.

Hui Fang - Dr Fang is a lecture in computer science at Loughborough University. He has significant experience 
of using machine learning techniques and visualization methods in a number of projects, e.g., EU FP6 
content-based video analysis, EPSRC face modelling, The Welsh Assembly funded Research Institute of Visual Computing 
(RIVIC) project and Innovate UK funded seismic data visual bulletin analysis (VBAS) project. Dr Hui Fangâ€™s research 
interest is applying visual computing and AI technologies to digital healthcare, precision agriculture, 
business intelligence, environment change monitoring, and contemporary transportation systems.
