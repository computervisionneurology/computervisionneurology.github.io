Our group focuses on the Computer Vision and AI applied to neurological diseases. Members of the group share a vision to develop technologies
that can be used by clinicians and patients to improve health outcomes for people who are affected by neurological conditions. Our interdisciplinary
expertise spans Clinical Neurology, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Statistics, and Health Informatics.

Our collaborators include world-leading clinicians from the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation and Royal United Hospitals Trusts, and Aire Logic,
the UK's largest healthtech consultancy.

Current Projects and Opportunities
======
We are currently investigating the limitations of subjective assessment of motor skills, 
and developing computer vision tools that allow objective assessment. Recent work has
included:

1. Automatic, video-based measurement of hand tremor frequency and amplitude.
2. Inter-rater reliability comparison of neurologist assessment of finger-tapping bradykinesia.
